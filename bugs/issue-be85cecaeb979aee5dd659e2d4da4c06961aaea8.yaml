title: Unify integration of builtin packages
desc: |-
  Currently getopt, obstack and zlib are optional builtin packages.
  Still they are handled differently wrt. configure logic.
  The ideal behaviour would be to have:
  1. The exact same configure look and feel and
  2. A reliable configure check to decide if the builtin version is used.
