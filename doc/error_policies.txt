Initial document concerning error policy decisions

   * ASSERT 
   
	Primarily used for internal development, failure on these
        asserts indicates a likely internal bug that requires
        modification of the library code by the developers.  These
        checks are only performed in debug mode.

   * ASSERT_VERBOSE (does not yet exist...)

        Used for checks that do not depend on third party software,
	but are likely caused by improper use of the library by the
	user.  The verbose error message and likely failure cause
	should be transparent to the user, without knowledge of the
	library internals.  These checks are only performed in debug
	mode.

   * CHECK_ABORT

        Used when we are depending on third party software, and
        updates to their code or different builds of the same code
        could generate errors.  These should always be checked.
