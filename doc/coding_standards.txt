This file describes a list of coding standards that the SC Library
tries to adhere to.

 * Indentation
   All .c and .h files must be indented with the scindent script in
   the main directory.  It calls GNU indent with some extra options.
   This does not apply for included third party code.

 * All bool parameters will not be checked with (a==true) or (a==false).  One
   should follow the standard C convention where (a) is used to test true
   and (!a) is used to test false.

 * Variable names that are not self-descriptive
   Loop variables of type int can be named as usual: i, j, etc.
   Loop variables of type size_t should be named iz, jz, etc.
   Loop variables of type ssize_t should be named is, js, etc.

 * Printf and friends on 64bit integers, size_t, etc.
   We will have to wait until all compilers and some lint checkers
   understand printf ("%jd %ju", (intmax_t) i, (uintmax_t) u) since that
   is a nice way to accomodate 128bit integers without changing the printf
   code.  In the mean time, we're using printf ("%lld %llu", (long long)
   i, (unsigned long long) j) which is unsafe for 128 bit integers.
   This also holds for size_t since support for the following is still
   incomplete: printf ("%zd %zu", ssize_t_var, size_t_var).
