# OBSOLETE MACRO
#
#   Replaced by AC_C_RESTRICT in Autoconf 2.58
#
# SYNOPSIS
#
#   ACX_C_RESTRICT
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   This macro determines whether the C compiler supports the
#   "restrict" keyword introduced in ANSI C99, or an equivalent. Does
#   nothing if the compiler accepts the keyword. Otherwise, if the
#   compiler supports an equivalent (like gcc's __restrict__) defines
#   "restrict" to be that. Otherwise, defines "restrict" to be empty.
